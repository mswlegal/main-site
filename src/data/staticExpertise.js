      <h1>What to Do Immediately After a Car Accident in California or Nevada</h1>
      <p><strong>After a car crash</strong>, your actions can greatly impact your physical recovery and legal rights. First, seek medical attentionâ€”even if you feel fine, internal injuries may take time to appear. Call the police and get a formal report. Document the scene by taking photos, collecting witness info, and noting road and weather conditions. These steps create a solid foundation for your personal injury claim.</p>

      <p>If your car was totaled or you got injured in the crash, it's important to seek legal advice promptly to protect your rights and maximize your compensation.</p>

      <h2>Why You Should Speak to a Car Accident Lawyer Before the Insurance Company</h2>
      <p>Insurance companies are not on your side. Their goal is to pay out as little as possibleâ€”and theyâ€™re trained to get you to settle fast. At Mendez & Sanchez APC, our car crash attorneys protect your rights from day one. We handle all communication with insurers, investigate your claim thoroughly, and fight for the full compensation you deserve for medical bills, lost wages, vehicle damage, pain and suffering, and long-term care if needed.</p>
